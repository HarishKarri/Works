Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it
down into a collection of simpler subproblems,solving each of those
subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.


An algorithm is designed to achieve optimum solution for a given problem. 
In greedy algorithm approach, decisions are made from the given solution domain. As being greedy, the closest solution that seems to provide an optimum solution is chosen.
Greedy algorithms try to find a localized optimum solution, 
which may eventually lead to globally optimized solutions. 
However, generally greedy algorithms do not provide globally optimized solutions.


Array is a container which stores the fixed size of elements and of same type.

Linkedlist is sequence of nodes which are connected with links.

Stack is a derived data structure which follows LIFO operation. ITems can be inserted using push() and removed by using pop().. same as like stack of plates.

Queue is a derived data structure same like stack which follows FIFO operation and has two ways open to insert and to remove from other end. Same like driving the car in a single way.

Graph is pictorial representation of set of vertices (A,B,C) whcih are connected by edges (AB,AC,BC)

Graph can be traverses through Depth first seach and Breadth first search Algorithms.

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges which has special condition where the parent node wil have two child nodes.
